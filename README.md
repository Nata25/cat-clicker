## Cat clicker app

A funny tutorial project for [Javascript Design Patterns course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989) in _Udacity_. 

This is a core JavaScript app organized according to MVC pattern.

=================================================================

We have a list of items (cats:) which are selectable and clickable. 
Each item has a name, a picture and the amount of clicks it has got so far. 
The number of clicks on every item is changed and stored independently.

Entering _admin mode_ one can change either of data about currently selected item.
Changes are applied on pressing `Save` button.

See how it works on [GitHub Pages](https://nata25.github.io/cat-clicker/)
