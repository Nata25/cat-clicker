## Cat clicker app

A funny tutorial project for [Javascript Design Patterns course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989) on _Udacity_. 

This is a Vanilla JavaScript app organized according to MVC pattern.

__________________________________________________________________

We have a list of items (cats ðŸ˜º) which are selectable and clickable. 
Each item has a name, a picture and the amount of clicks it has got so far. 
The number of clicks on every item is changed and stored independently.

Entering `admin mode` (a button click) one can change any of the data about currently selected item.
Changes are applied on pressing `Save` button or denied on `Cancel`. 
Keyboard options are implemented as well.

See how it works on [GitHub Pages](https://nata25.github.io/cat-clicker/).
